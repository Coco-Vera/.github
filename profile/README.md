# Coco-Vera by 19206 Gharbiya üå±

Welcome to **Coco-Vera**! We are **Team 19206** from **STEM Gharbiya**, and this is our project aimed at tackling the problem of **water pollution**. Specifically, we are focusing on developing an eco-friendly, sustainable solution to filter textile wastewater, which is one of the leading contributors to water pollution. Our project uses natural materials like coconut husks, cactus gel, and biosand to create a low-cost, effective filtration system that targets critical water quality parameters such as pH, TDS, and turbidity.

## üåç What‚Äôs Coco-Vera All About?

The **Coco-Vera Project** is dedicated to finding solutions for the environmental issues caused by the textile industry. By using sustainable materials, we aim to reduce the harmful impact of wastewater on our ecosystem. Our goal is to provide an affordable, scalable filtration system that can be used in various industries, helping them minimize their water pollution footprint.

Our key focus areas include:

- **Reducing Turbidity**: Using natural filters to clear the water.
- **Adjusting pH Levels**: Ensuring water is within a safe pH range.
- **Reducing TDS**: Minimizing Total Dissolved Solids in the water.
